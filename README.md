# RAMOS Ink
RAMOS Ink converts InkML files received from a Livescribe Smartpen's penlet to image and/or video. This tool is a part of the RAMOS system, developed to run in an independent way.

## Building and Distribution

To produce a jar file, there may have alternative ways of doing this, but we used [Eclipse Luna](https://eclipse.org/) and a plugin called [e(fx)clipse](https://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/index.html) following the steps above:

1.  Within the Project's root directory, locate and open "build.fxbuild" using the IDE;
2.  You may see a option called "Generate ant build.xml only" that should appears as a link;
3.  After the processing the "build" directory is created;
4.  Take a look at the file "build.xml" inside the "build" directory (a comprehensive xml file that may have no problems, some people across the web experienced resources issues but didn't notice something like that in this project until now);
5.  Right click on it and choose "Run As" followed by "Ant Build";
6.  After the procedure the distribution jar is inside the "dist" directory (within "build").

_Notice that the jar file needs the "libs" directory to correctly function! So Distribute the jar file with the "libs" directory in the same path!_
